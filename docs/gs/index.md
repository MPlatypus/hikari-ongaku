|Question|Answer|
|--------|------|
|Why can't I use ongaku with a rest bot?|Ongaku relies on events, like the [Voice Server Update](https://docs.hikari-py.dev/en/latest/reference/hikari/events/voice_events/#hikari.events.voice_events.VoiceServerUpdateEvent) and the [Voice State Update](https://docs.hikari-py.dev/en/latest/reference/hikari/events/voice_events/#hikari.events.voice_events.VoiceStateUpdateEvent) events. Without them, the bot has no idea if its joined a voice channel, or the websocket connection, that it can stream audio to.|
|What is Ongaku compatible with?|Ongaku should be compatible with all hikari based command handlers and component handlers, however, further testing is required.|
